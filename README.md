# BTD_AndroidGame
We had a course that required to create and android app so i created a btd6 clone its not the prettiest but has all the main features also has a leaderboad and achivemnt system, but if you look in the code only works on ku Leuven network so when u first enter the game ENTER IN GUEST MODE becuase regorstartion and logging in wont work. also you can use this project however you like ;).
